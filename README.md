# Linear Regression Model

## Project Overview
This project implements a simple **Linear Regression model** using Python. The model uses **gradient descent** for optimization and includes various utilities for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. The main goal of this project is to predict car prices based on mileage data.

## Features
- **Gradient Descent Algorithm**: Optimizes the linear model parameters (slope and intercept) to minimize the loss function.
- **Normalization**: Normalizes the input data for better training performance.
- **Loss Functions**:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The primary loss function used for training.
  - **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes **RÂ² score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to measure model performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Built-in plotting functions to visualize the dataset and the linear regression line.
